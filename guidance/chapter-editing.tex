\chapter{Reviewing and editing}
\label{ch:review}


While reviewing, it is possible to mark up the document with simple
\LaTeX{} macros as provided by the ``todonotes'' class.

Note: if you do not see the examples in this section your copy may
have been built with the ``\texttt{final}'' option turned on.

\section{Inline ``fixme''}

You may prefer to place an inline note to mark up the text.
This can be accomplished with a  \verb|\fixme{...}| command, e.g.,

\fixme{Think of something critical about this sentence.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Margin notes}

You can easily add notes to the \todo{run spell checker} margine  which
are associated with some text using:

\begin{verbatim}
\todo{run spell checker.}
\end{verbatim}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Highlighting}

If you wish to add a comment on some section of text you may
\hlfix{highlight it}{This shows how.} with a comment.


\begin{verbatim}
\hlfix{highlight it}{This shows how.}
\end{verbatim}
