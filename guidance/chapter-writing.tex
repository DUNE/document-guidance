\chapter{Writing \LaTeX}

This is the start of a chapter and gives some introduction before its first section.  This chapter describes basic \LaTeX{} you need to know.

\section{Sectioning}
\label{sec:sectioning}

About subdividing a document into chapters, sections, subsections, and so on:

\begin{itemize}
\item A subdivision of a larger portion should have content that relates to some aspect of the larger portion. 
\item  If you subdivide, create at least two subdivisions, one for each comparable aspect. Otherwise, the topic of your one subdivision is (by definition) the same as that of the larger portion.
\item In your \LaTeX{} source, add lines of percent signs (comments) to make it easy to find where sections begin and end (as illustrated in this file).
\item {}
\end{itemize}


The following sectioning macros are available, ordered from bigger to smaller:

\begin{verbatim}
\chapter{A Chapter}
\section{A Section}
\subsection{A Sub Section}
\subsubsection{A Sub Sub Section}
\subsubsubsection{A Sub Sub Sub Section}
\end{verbatim}

Three sub's is all you get.  
Consult with the technical editors if you feel finer grained
sectioning is required.
Starting from \verb|\subsection|, this produces the following:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{A Sub Section}

This is a subsection.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{A Sub Sub Section}

This is a subsubsection.

%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsubsection{A Sub Sub Sub Section}

This is a subsubsubsection and is getting to be a bit too fine-grained. It will not appear in 
the table of contents, which will show entries as low as subsubsection only.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Section Labels}

Just after defining a chapter and any significant section a
\verb|\label| should be added so it can be referenced.
A label can be added later for a `'less significant'' section that
turns out to need one. You can label them all. 

For example:

\begin{verbatim}
\chapter{A Chapter}
\label{ch:a-chapter}

\section{A Section}
\label{sec:a-section}

\subsection{A Sub Section}
\label{subsec:a-subsection}
\end{verbatim}

See Section~\ref{sec:refs} for how to reference labeled sections.

\section{Figures}
\label{sec:figures}

See Section~\ref{sec:figure-format} for guidelines on the graphics files themselves.
Instead of using the usual \texttt{figure} environment a custom \texttt{cdrfigure}
environment is used in order to provide for a consistent presentation.
The environment is called with one optional and two required
arguments:

\begin{enumerate}
\item An initial, optional short caption for the List Of Figures, in square brackets.
\item A (required) label for referencing (do not prepend \texttt{fig:} --  \LaTeX{} will do that automatically). Curly brackets. It is helpful to have this label match the filename of the figure. 
\item The (required) full caption. Curly brackets, again.
\end{enumerate}

This is followed by including the graphic file. Here is an example:

\begin{cdrfigure}[Short ToF caption]{aerial}{An aerial photograph of Fermilab
    showing Wilson Hall and surrounding accelerator rings (Fermilab
    Visual Media Services)}
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{fermilab-aerial.jpg}
\end{cdrfigure}


When the figure contains a graphic,  usually \texttt{includegraphics} is used.
The filename is assumed relative to a \texttt{graphicspath} as
mentioned in Section~\ref{ssec:files-pdunesp-tdr} and as such, one typically should
\textbf{not} specify any directory parts in its name.
The file's extension may be omitted.
An example can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:aerial}, which is created
with the following \LaTeX{} and is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:aerial-latex}.  Notice that in these references to the figures, we need to prepend \texttt{fig:} to the label.

\begin{cdrfigure}[]{aerial-latex}{\LaTeX{} showing how to include a figure.}

\begin{verbatim}
    \begin{cdrfigure}[Short ToF caption.]{aerial}{An aerial photograph
      of Fermilab showing Wilson Hall and surrounding accelerator rings 
      (Fermilab Visual Media Services)}
      \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{fermilab-aerial.jpg}
    \end{cdrfigure}
\end{verbatim}

\end{cdrfigure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Tables}
\label{sec:tables}

Like figures, we use a special environment, \texttt{cdrtable} for
tables to achieve a degree of consistency.
This is instead of the usual double \texttt{table} + \texttt{tabular} environments.
The \texttt{cdrtable} environment takes one optional and three
required arguments:

\begin{enumerate}
\item An initial, optional short caption for the List of Tables. Square brackets.
\item The tabular column specification. Curly brackets for the last three.
\item A label for referencing (it will have \texttt{tab:} prepended automatically)
\item The full caption.
\end{enumerate}

Inside the actual contents of the table you are required to provide a
initial row containing the headings for the table's rows followed by a
\texttt{toprowrule} macro.
Following every regular row (except the last) you should include a
\texttt{colline} macro.
Both of these take the place of the usual \texttt{hline}.

\begin{cdrtable}[The LoT caption]{cc}{example}
{This is an example table.}
  Rows & Counts \\ \toprowrule
  Row 1 & First \\ \colhline
  Row 2 & Second \\ \colhline
  Row 3 & Third \\ 
\end{cdrtable}

\noindent Table~\ref{tab:example} is thus made like (arguments can span lines):

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{cdrtable}[The LoT caption]{cc}{example}
{This is an example table.}
  Rows & Counts \\ \toprowrule
  Row 1 & First \\ \colhline
  Row 2 & Second \\ \colhline
  Row 3 & Third \\ 
\end{cdrtable}
\end{verbatim}

Table~\ref{tab:pdecay} shows a more complex example.
See the source for how it is written.
Note that special column specifications are used.

\begin{cdrtable}[Efficiencies and background rates for nucleon decay
  modes]{$L^c^c^c^c}{pdecay}{Efficiencies and background rates for
    nucleon decay channels of interest for a large underground LArTPC,
    and comparison with water Cherenkov detector capabilities} %$
  Decay Mode & \multicolumn{2}{^c}{Water Cherenkov} & 
\multicolumn{2}{^c}{Liquid Argon TPC} \\
\rowtitlestyle
& Efficiency & Background & Efficiency & Background \\ \toprowrule
$p \rightarrow K^+ \overline{\nu}$ & 19\% & 4 & 97\% & 1 \\ \colhline
$p \rightarrow K^0 \mu^+$ & 10\% & 8 & 47\% & $<2 $ \\ \colhline
$p \rightarrow K^+ \mu^- \pi^+$ & & & 97\% & 1 \\ \colhline
$n \rightarrow K^+ e^- $ & 10\% & 3 & 96\% & $<2$ \\ \colhline
$n \rightarrow e^+\pi^-$ & 19\% & 2 & 44\% & 0.8 \\
\end{cdrtable}

\section{Referencing and Citations}
\label{sec:refs}

Note: if you see a faint grey label containing \texttt{sec:refs}
between this paragraph and the section heading (or in general
elsewhere in chapters, sections, figures, etc.), it means this document
was built in draft mode.  The web page \url{https://github.com/DUNE/document-guidance} discusses
compilation in ``draft'' vs ``print'' mode.
These artifacts show up to help you know what label was used to
reference each particular thing.  Again, it's easiest to trace things when the labels are meaningful, and for figures, when they match the image filename.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Intra-document References}

Assume that any chapter, section or important sub-, subsub-, section
or within any figure or table environment may need to be referenced
elsewhere in the text. As described in Section~\ref{sec:sectioning},
define a label (\verb|\label{...}| for these items.
Use the defined label in a \verb|\ref{...}| in order to make reference
to the chapter, section, figure, etc.
For example:

\begin{verbatim}
\chapter{Some Chapter}
\label{ch:some-chapter}

\subsection{Some Sub Section}
\label{subsec:some-sub-section}

...

As described in Chapter~\ref{ch:some-chapter} ...

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fermilab-aerial} ...
\end{verbatim}

When you reference a chapter, section, subsection, figure, table,
etc., capitalize the word ``Chapter'' or whatever it is, e.g., ``as
shown in Section~\ref{sec:plots}.''
Use the word ``Section'' even if it's a subsection or subsubsection,
and use the tilde sign to keep the number on the same line as the word
that precedes it.

For figures, the reference needs to include ``fig'' before the label name, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:figures}, and for tables, ``tab'' must be prepended (Section~\ref{sec:tables}).


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Citations}

Referencing citations is done like \verb|\cite{strunk}| which gives \cite{strunk}.
(Compiling the bibliography entries into the document requires an extra step: run ``bibtex'' on
 guidance.tex, then run pdflatex on it again a couple of times. Otherwise you'll see [?] here 
 and no bibliography entry at the end.) 
The key \texttt{strunk} matches an entry in the \texttt{common/citedb.bib}
file (as relative to the top-level directory).


The \texttt{citedb.bib} file is in BibTex format.
This is \textbf{not} \LaTeX{} format and in particular does not
indicate comments via \texttt{\%} characters.
The content and order of entries in this file is not reflected in the
generated Bibliography.
However, manual care must be taken to avoid duplication.
Before adding any entry to \texttt{citedb.bib} read/search through it
to ascertain that the entry you wish to add is not already there.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Common Names}

To enforce consistency, use a \LaTeX{} macro in place of any name or
term which is frequently used.
It is especially important to do this if the name or term is subject
to multiple ``spellings''.
The file \texttt{common/defs.tex} is where all such macros should be defined.

Some examples:

\begin{itemize}
\item \dm{21} is written as \verb|\dm{21}|.
\item \SURF is written as \verb|\SURF|.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Numbers and Units}

\textbf{All} numerical quantities expressed as literal number
\textbf{must} have units unless they are inherently do not have a unit.
In order to enforce consistency the \texttt{siunitx} package is used
and a collection of common units are defined in
\texttt{common/units.tex}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Bare Numbers}

To enforce consistent writing of numbers encase them in the
\verb|\num{}| command:

\begin{itemize}
\item ``\num{100}'' is written as \verb|\num{100}|.
\item ``\num{1000}'' is written as \verb|\num{1000}|.
\item ``\num{123.456}'' is written as \verb|\num{123.456}|.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Bare Units}

If you need to write a bare unit, one with not associated number, use
\verb|\si{}| (lower case ``si'')

\begin{itemize}
\item ``\si{m}'' is written \verb|\si{m}|.
\item ``\si{pc}'' is written \verb|\si{pc}|.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Numbers and Units}

When a quantity has a unit write both the numerical part and the unit
using the \verb|\SI{}{}| command like:

\begin{itemize}
\item ``\SI{120}{GeV}'' is written as \verb|\SI{120}{GeV}|.
\item ``\SI{4850}{foot}'' is written as \verb|\SI{4850}{foot}|
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Adjective Quantities}

Some language uses quantities as adjectives.
These require proper outfitting with a dash which is easy to forget.
To accommodate this a set of ``adjective quantities'' commands are defined.
A generic \verb|\SIadj| is provided as are some commonly used ones.
For example:

\begin{itemize}
\item ``The \SIadj{4850}{ft} level'' is written as \verb|The \SIadj{4850}{ft} level|.
\item ``The \ftadj{4850} level'' is written as \verb|The \ftadj{4850} level|.
\item ``A typical \GeVadj{2} event'' is written as \verb|A typical \GeVadj{2} event|.
\item 
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Common compound units}

There are some common units that rather long to type out each time
especially when we require nice formatting.

\begin{itemize}
\item ``per \msr'' is written as \verb|per \msr|
\item ``exposure in \ktmwyr{}s'' is written as \verb|exposure in \ktmwyr{}s|
\end{itemize}
