  \dword{kloe}{KLOE}{KLOE is a $e^+ e^-$ collider detector spectrometer operated at DAFNE, the $\phi$-meson factory at Frascati, Rome. In DUNE it will consist of a \SI{26}{cm} Pb+scintillating fiber ECAL surrounding a cylindrical open detector region that is  \SI{4.00}{m} in diameter and \SI{4.30}{m} long. The ECAL and detector region are embedded in a \SI{0.6}{T} magnetic field created by a \SI{4.86}{m} diameter superconducting coil and a \SI{475}{tonne} iron yoke}
