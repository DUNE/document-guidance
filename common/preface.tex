\chapter*{A Roadmap of the DUNE Technical Design Report}

The \dword{dune} \dword{fd} \dword{tdr} describes the proposed physics program,  
detector designs, and management structures and procedures at the technical design stage.  

The TDR is composed of five volumes, as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Volume~\volnumberexec{} (\voltitleexec{}) provides an overview of all of DUNE for science policy professionals.

\item Volume~\volnumberphysics{} (\voltitlephysics{}) describes the DUNE physics program.

\item Volume~\volnumbertc{} (\voltitletc{}) outlines DUNE management structures, methodologies, procedures, requirements, and risks. 

\item Volume~\volnumbersp{} (\voltitlesp{}) and Volume~\volnumberdp{} (\voltitledp{}) describe the two \dword{fd} \dword{lartpc} technologies.

\end{itemize}

The text includes terms that hyperlink to definitions in a volume-specific glossary. These terms  appear underlined in some online browsers, if enabled in the browser's settings.
