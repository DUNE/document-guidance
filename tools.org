* Build Tools

The documents in this repository can be built with your favorite LaTeX
tools in their usual manner.  In addition, support for some specific
tools and build methods is provided.

The control.tex file controls whether a volume gets compiled as "draft" with edit markings (fixmes and line numbers) or print ready, i.e., a clean compilation without those markings. Its content is either:
# For draft, either empty or %\def\isfinal{1}
# For print \def\isfinal{1}

Each top-level TeX file interprets the control file via the lines:
# \input{control}
# \ifdefined\isfinal\documentclass[final]{dune}\else\documentclass{dune}\fi
 
The control.tex file can be adjusted manually. Or it can be set automatically by using the compileit script.

** The ~compileit~ script

The ~compileit~ script simply calls the standard low-level TeX tools,
builds the documents in "draft" or "print" mode (removes line numbers
and hides fixmes) and provides some clean up of TeX's intermediate
files.  The three modes of operation are as in this example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  # build a document in "draft" mode.
  ./compileit executive-summary.tex [draft]
  # build a document in "print" mode
  ./compileit executive-summary.tex print
  # Clean out all the generated files except the PDF
  ./compileit executive-summary.tex clean
  Not removing:
  executive-summary.pdf
#+END_EXAMPLE

Likewise, the ~compileit~ script can be run on the other top-level
volume TeX files.  Note that intermediate files are created directly
in the top level source directory.  Take care not to ~git add~ them.

The "clean" argument gets rid of all the intermediate files, keeping the .tex and the .pdf files only.

** Waf build

A [[https://waf.io/][Waf]] build system is provided which will build all the volume PDFs as
well as generate per-chapter main TeX files and build them to PDF.
The commands to run are as below.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ./waf configure [--prefix=/path/to/install] [--prompt-level=1]  (1)
  ./waf -p                                                          (2)
  ./waf install                                                   (3)
#+END_EXAMPLE

1) The one-time configuration of the build is required.  Two options
   may be given.  A "prefix" location specifies an absolute or
   relative path to where you might want the resulting PDFs to be
   "installed".  A "prompt level" of 1 means that you will see all of
   LaTeX's output and be able to respond to any error prompts while 0
   means a quieter, less informative output.

2) Actually build the documents.  This will run tasks in parallel on
   as many cores as your computer provides.  Results will land in the
   ~build/~ directory.  After any changes to the documents (including
   a ~git pull~ this step should be redone.

3) Optionally, "install" the results to the prefix specified in step (1).

If you are not interested in building the entire volume set you may
narrow what ~waf~ builds.  For example to build just the SP DAQ
chapter PDF:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ./waf --targets=far-detector-single-phase-chapter-fdsp-daq.pdf
#+END_EXAMPLE

While it should not be required to modify them, the ~chapters.tex~ and
~chapters.sh~ files are used in this build.

*** Debugging problems with Waf

By default waf runs in a parallel mode which causes a lot of LaTeX
output to flash by on your terminal.  When there is an error, Waf will
terminate with a Python stack trace.  You must then scroll the
terminal to try to find the detail errors from LaTeX itself.  This can
be rather tedious.

More easily, when Waf "crashes" you can rerun it while instructing it
to run LaTeX in a serial fashion and also to turn on the usual LaTeX
interactivity.  This can be accomplished with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ./waf -j1 --prompt-level=1
#+END_EXAMPLE

This can help see 

** The ~latexmk~ tool

The ~latexmk~ tool is very handy to use while editing as it can watch
the TeX source, recompile each time a file is saved and refresh a PDF
viewer.  To use it effectively requires some special configuration
which is in the ~.latexmkrc~ file in this repository.  Simply running
it from the source directory should work.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  # one shot:
  latexmk executive-summary
  ls -l latexmk-out/*.pdf
  # or, have it watch the TeX files, rebuild and refresh your PDF viewer 
  latexmk -pvc executive-summary
#+END_EXAMPLE

Depending on your local environment (eg, which PDF viewer you prefer)
additional configuration may be required.  The ~.latexmk~ has some
commented out suggestions.  If these are useful to you, do *not*
uncomment them in this file but rather copy them to your personal
=~/.latexmkrc= file.

The per-chapter TeX documents produced by the Waf build above can also
be leveraged here to create an editing environment with fast builds.
First build the desired PDF with ~waf~ and then use its ~.tex~ file
with ~latexmk~.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ./waf --targets=far-detector-single-phase-chapter-fdsp-daq.pdf
  latexmk -pvc build/far-detector-single-phase-chapter-fdsp-daq.tex
#+END_EXAMPLE

You may now edit the TeX files used by this chapter and each save
should rerun ~pdflatex~ and refresh your PDF viewer.
